And the second reason is just my personal preference of not wanting my podcasts in the same place as my music.

It's not even like I care for every feature Spotify offers but the ones I do care about are often missing or fundamentally flawed on other platforms. I'd love to switch to YouTube music since I'm paying for premium anyways but their library management UI isn't quite up to my standards. Not that Spotify is perfect in that regard but it's better than any other streaming service I've seen. I've been hesitant to give Apple a chance in part because I'm on Android and from what I've heard it's a subpar experience on Android. Truly the biggest hindrance no matter what platform you're on to me though is migrating your library over never seems like a completely reliable or reasonably simple task to accomplish making it practically impossible to fully compare different streaming services unless you're willing to dedicate multiple months to that process. \n",

I make playlists, obviously, but I primarily find myself interacting with music on an artist/album level and like to maintain a library of music that I like, and I find Apple Music’s design to cater to that experience, whereas Spotify’s UX feels more centered around playlists. \\n\\nIn addition to all of that, I continue to be frustrated by Spotify’s recent foray into the podcast space for two reasons… First, as a longtime podcast enthusiast, it makes me really sad to see what has historically been a free and open standard of distribution locked behind a paywall. And the second reason is just my personal preference of not wanting my podcasts in the same place as my music. When I want to listen to music, I want to listen to music and when I want to listen to podcasts, I want to listen to podcasts. I don’t need recommendations for either one cluttering up the other one’s experience. \\n\\nAll of that being said… I do feel like Spotify has a slightly better recommendations algorithm, which is something I hope Apple continues to improve upon, which results in a slightly better music discovery experience on Spotify. And the Spotify Wrapped feature does always give me a bit of FOMO. \\n\\nTLDR: I feel like Spotify users assume Apple Music fans are just Apple fans, but I do have very specific reasons for why I _personally_ prefer Apple Music.

Also for anyone used to (I don’t know if other systems do this) audio pro  multitoom speakers? Apple Music is one speaker/set from a device. Spotify (connect, that you pay for) the phone or computer is simply a remote can quit the app and keeps playing from Wi-Fi to speakers . So can turn down music and take a call…there’s things of fires I wish were better but 1) Apple Music people think they’re getting a level of sound quality they aren’t, 2) AirPlay is device dependent and if you use anything but one set of headphones earbuds Spotify connect speakers are way better.
